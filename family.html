<p><h3>I still have parents.My father's name is Syed Mohd Bashirron bin Syed Hamzah and my mother's name is Juliawati binti Rani. Both are already 50 years old.
My siblings's name are Syarifah Nur Huda and Syarifah Nur Wafa. 
I also have two younger sisters who are still in preschool and high school.
They are still 13 years old and 6 years old. As the eldest child, I need to set a good example to my younger siblings so that 
they do not follow negative behaviors.</p></h3>
